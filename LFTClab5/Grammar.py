Grammar Class
The Grammar class represents a context-free grammar (CFG) and provides methods for initializing, reading CFG information from a file, checking CFG validity, and obtaining a string representation of the grammar.

Attributes:
EPSILON (class attribute):

A string constant representing the empty string, often denoted as Îµ or "epsilon."
non_term (list):

Non-terminals of the CFG.
term (list):

Terminals of the CFG.
start (string):

The starting symbol or axiom of the CFG.
production (dictionary):

Stores the finite set of productions, where keys are non-terminals, and values are lists of possible right-hand sides.
Methods:
__init__(self)

Initializes a Grammar object with empty lists for non-terminals, terminals, an empty string for the starting symbol, and an empty production dictionary.
rebuild(self)

Resets all attributes of the Grammar object to an empty state, facilitating the reconstruction of a new CFG.
__processLine(self, line: str, delimiter=' ') -> List[str]

Helper method that processes a line of text by splitting it into elements based on a specified delimiter. Returns a list of elements.
read_from_file(self, file_name: str) -> None

Reads CFG information from the specified file, populating the Grammar object with non-terminals, terminals, the starting symbol, and production rules.
check_cfg(self) -> bool

Checks the validity of the CFG by ensuring it has a starting symbol, and all symbols used in production rules are either non-terminals, terminals, or epsilon. Returns True if valid, False otherwise.
__str__(self) -> str

Generates a string representation of the CFG, including non-terminals, terminals, the starting symbol, and production rules. Suitable for displaying the CFG details when printed.
