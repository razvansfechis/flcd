The class that performs the scanning is called Scanner
Scanner consists of: 
	- SymbolTable, where we store identifiers and constants tokens
	- ProgramInternalForm where we store all the all the tokens
Scanner has the following methods:
	- getTokensFromFile: parses the file and gets all the tokens 
	- checkTypeToken: gets all the tokens from the getTokensFromFile method and checks if they are either a reserved word, a separator, an operator and identfier or a constant 
		                  if they are an identifier or a constant then they are added to the SymbolTable aswell as to the ProgramInternalForm, otherwise they are only added to the ProgramInternalFrom
	- in the scanner we have the: 
		- operators, defined as: ["+", "-", "*", "/", "==", "<", "<=", ">", ">=", "=", "<-", "%", ":"]
		- separators, defined as: ["{", "}", "(", ")", "[", "]", ";", " ", "\t", "\n", ","]
		- reserved words, defined as: ["if", "else", "read", "write", "integer", "string", "return"]
		- regex for identifiers: "^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*"
		- regex for constants:  "0|([1-9]+[0-9]*)"
Along as those, we have :
	Files: p1.txt, p1err.txt, p2.txt, p3.txt where we get the input
	Class Pair which returns a pair : (first, second)
	Class HashTable and SymbolTable, the SymbolTable being implemented using the HashTable class
